						<h3>Hustling It Out of Chongqing</h3>
						<p class"date">April 12, 2016</p>
						<p>I couldn't get out of this city fast enough. Thirty million people crammed into a circular basin, everyone wanting to own their own car, were generating the foulest smog I have yet breathed in all my travels of the world's cities. It threatened to end my life before my trek even started. But wading through the necessary red tape for the expedition required a few days in . . .  [read more]</p>

						<h3>It's Not All Hiking</h3>
						<p class"date">April 14, 2016</p>
						<p>This trek isn't all going to be about hiking. I'll be taking local cross-country buses as much as possible, then hitching rides on trucks, cars, and even animal-draft wagons, getting far into the interior before I have to strike out on horse or foot to find the best views on the high ridge crests and plateau rims. There is no practical reason, after all, for the roads and paths to take . . . [read more]</p>

						<h3>The Damned Dams</h3>
						<p class"date">April 24, 2016</p>
						<p>While this is only the first of many I will likely pass by on this trek, it is definitely the biggest. Xiaowan Dam on the Langcang, as the Mekong is known in these upper reaches, is the second-highest arch dam in the world, 958 feet high, although so broad it doesn't look so big until one gets close. Virtually every stretch of China's formerly free-flowing big rivers are now flooded by long, . . . [read more]</p>

						<h3>Transferring Buses around a Landslide</h3>
						<p class"date">April 26, 2016</p>
						<p>The bus couldn't go any farther on this narrow mountain-hugging road due to a washout that took all of the pavement for thirty yards or so. A precarious path haas been carved out of the barren hillside, and everyone was ferrying luggage very carefully to the other side where another bus awaited us for the next leg of the trip. I expect this may be more common than most . . . [read more]</p>

						<h3>A Village Monastery</h3>
						<p class"date">April 17, 2016</p>
						<p>When I arrived in this Doqing, the villagers insisted I stay with the monk who lives in a tiny monastery just up the hill from the town plaza. Dalik is a fairly young master, having been an acolyte there for most of his youth. Like the robed and shaven-headed boy who serves him now, he was born in this town and has never ventured beyond the great bend of the river that marks . . . [read more]</p>

						<h3>The Protected Forests</h3>
						<p class"date">April 21, 2016</p>
						<p>Despite the nation's willingness to sacrifice their great wild rivers on the altar of economic progress, a long tradition of native environmentalism is protecting the old-growth forests that look down upon the new reservoirs from the upland ridges and divides. These extensive forests protect the water sources, but also harbor animistic spirits of the land and are the abode of  . . . [read more]</p>
